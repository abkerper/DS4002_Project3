1. Identify reliable website to acquire images of birds
2. Use Cornellâ€™s Macaulay Library and Caltech-UCSD Birds Library to collect images of birds based on species
   1. Decided that the Cornell Library was not as robust as the Caltech-UCSD Library as the Caltech-UCSD Library had a much wider variety of bird species
   2. File type provided by the Cornell Library (.jpeg) did not match what was needed in our model (.jpg) so we did not end up using the images in the Cornell Library
3. Images from the Caltech-UCSD Library were downloaded into folders each representing a specific bird species as classified by the Caltech-UCSD Library
   1. Each folder contains 60 images of each species
4. Read the images into a pandas dataframe
